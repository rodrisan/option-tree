Customizable WordPress Theme Options Framework.

== Description ==

Theme Options are what make a Theme truly custom. OptionTree attempts to bridge the gap between developers, designers and end-users by solving the admin User Interface issues that arise when creating a custom theme. Designers shouldn't have to be limited to what they can create visually because their programming skills aren't as developed. Also, programers shouldn't have to recreate the wheel for every project. In walks OptionTree.

With OptionTree you can create as many Theme Options as your project requires and use them how you see fit. When you add a option to the Settings page, it will be available on the Theme Options page for use in your theme. Included is the ability to Import/Export all your theme options and data. You can create a theme locally and get it set up on a live server in minutes. 

Because of the ability to import and export, theme authors can now create different version of their themes and include them with the download. It makes setting up different theme style easier than ever.
